# C++ Project Creator
A set of scripts and Makefiles to automate the process of creating and compiling a C++ project from either a Windows command prompt or a bash shell on GNU/Linux or macOS
# Windows
The Windows version provides an automated Makefile, written in cmd script commands, as well as two scripts:
- setup-cpp-proj: configures a new project, with all the necessary directories and the Makefile
- echolored: a simple script that allows you to print colored strings

For both scripts more options are available. Use -? or --help to read the guide
# Bash
The Bash version also provides an automated Makefile written in bash commands, thus compatible with Linux and macOS systems
